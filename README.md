# FoodSaver

The idea of this product is to help with food waste. It's something that plagues the states and needs a new avenue of thinking to fix.
The general idea is for a restaurant or store to post their surplus food and a user can claim it, and pick up the surplus food. 
nearly 60 million tons of food every year, worth $218 billion, and that food waste contributes to 11 percent of global emissions.
We can lower this number with this app.

We're aiming for a retro very low requirement app that can run on almost any phone to make it more accessible to the homeless or poverty stricken.
This will be an opensource project that hopefully come to fruition, I believe it can help, will it eliminate the problem? No but everything counts for something.
Thank you for reading and if you're interested in working on the app, jump on! Anyone can contribute we are under the GPL v3 so I leave saving food waste and feeding homeless to the fine denizens of Github
