###Here's a basic Python class structure for the app's core functionality, keeping it simple:###

class FoodSaver:
    def __init__(self):
        self.food_items = {}
        self.users = {}

    def list_food(self, business_id, food_description, quantity, pickup_time):
        # Add food item to the dictionary
        self.food_items[len(self.food_items) + 1] = {
            "business_id": business_id,
            "description": food_description,
            "quantity": quantity,
            "pickup_time": pickup_time
        }
        return len(self.food_items)

    def alert_users(self, food_id):
        # This would ideally notify all app users, but here we'll just print for demonstration
        food = self.food_items.get(food_id, {})
        if food:
            print(f"Alert! Available food: {food['description']} at {food['pickup_time']}")

    def claim_food(self, user_id, food_id):
        # Check if food exists and claim it
        if food_id in self.food_items:
            claimed_food = self.food_items[food_id]
            claimed_food['claimed_by'] = user_id
            print(f"Food claimed by user {user_id}")
        else:
            print("Food not available")

    def add_user(self, user_id, name):
        self.users[user_id] = name

# Example usage
food_saver = FoodSaver()
food_saver.add_user("user1", "Khan")
food_id = food_saver.list_food("restaurant1", "Fresh Salad", "5 servings", "18:00")
food_saver.alert_users(food_id)
food_saver.claim_food("user1", food_id)
